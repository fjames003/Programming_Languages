(* A simple test harness for the MOCaml REPL. *)

(* put your tests here:
   each test is a pair of a MOCaml declaration and the expected
   result, both expressed as strings.
   use the string "dynamic type error" if a DynamicTypeError is expected to be raised.
   use the string "match failure" if a MatchFailure is expected to be raised.
   use the string "implement me" if an ImplementMe exception is expected to be raised

   call the function runReplTests() to run these tests
