First homework Friday. Due a week from Sunday.
Exercise: try ocaml (try.ocamlpro.com)

Homework due 11/7 is actually due 11/8.

let x = 3 + 2

let rec fact n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1
  | _ -> n * fact (n-1)

General form of match:
  match exp with
  | pat1 -> exp1
  | ...
  | patn -> expn

Patterns (so far):
  pat ::= num | _

Lists:
  [] (empty list aka "nil")
  non-empty lists [1], [1;2;3]

:: is called "cons"
it adds a new element to the "head"
of a list.

Cons is functional:
  let y = (1+2)::x
  x is unchanged.

The "head" of a non-empty list
 is its first element
The "tail" of a non-empty list
  is everything else (the rest of
  the list)

Linked list in C:
  struct Node {
    int elem;
    struct Node * next;
  }
  typedef struct Node * List;
  // List = struct Node *

A list is either:
  a null pointer (empty list)
  a non-null pointer to Node
    (int and a List)

  ASCII art: [1;2;3]
  Node{1 -}--> Node{2 -}--> Node{3 null}

In OCaml:
A list is either
  [] (empty list) (nil)
  (head::tail)
    (an element and a list)

  Cons{1 -}--> Cons{2 -}--> Cons{3 -}--> []
  
Same idea, but OCaml is a "higher level" language (pointers are hidden).

sumList uses a new pattern
  (hd::tl)

  Nested patterns.
  Pattern for ::, patterns for
  the head and the tail.

  Variable patterns. hd and tl
  are variable names.

  | hd::tl -> hd + sumList tl

Note: Ocaml is statically-type checked. So all branches of a match must have the same type. Also, all patterns must match the same type.

(Expressions)
E ::= C | X | if E then E else E
    | let X=E
    | match E with P1 -> E1
      '|' P2 -> E2
    | ...
(Constants)
C ::= 1,[]

(Variables)
X ::= <variables>

(Patterns)
P ::= C | _ | P::P | X

Strategy for writing recursive Functions:
  1) Think about the base case(s).
     Usually the easy part.
  2) Think about about the
     recursive case(s).
     Depends on the structure of
     the data being traversed.
     - Assume that the recursive
       call(s) do the right thing.
     - Combine the results.
  3) Magically works!
  
everyOther : 'a list -> 'a list 
  "polymorphic"
  'a is a type variable.
  We'll talk more about polymorphism (in OCaml and other languages) later.

everyOther [1;2;3]
everyOther ["";"hi";"bye"]
  
Sometimes we want to give names to intermediate values.

New form of expression:
   let P = E in E
Let can do pattern matching too! You've seen this already, when I write "let _ = ..." in the examples.

Note: let without "in" only allowed at the "top level"

"Top level expression": an expression that is not a subexpression of any other (outer) expression.

Tuples:
  Like lists, contain multiple elements
  Two differences:
    Elements can have different types.
    The type of a tuple tells you how many elements it has.

  (1, "hi", 2.0)  has type  (int * string * float)
  (1, "hi")       has type  (int * string) 


Examples:
========================================

let ls = [1,""] (* Not a 2-element list *)
let ls = [1;""] (* A 2-element list *)

let x= [4;5]
let y = (1+2) :: x
let _ = x (* Functional: x is unchanged *)
let _ = y (* y is a new list *)

let rec sumList lst =
  match lst with
  | [] -> 0
  | hd::tl -> hd + sumList tl

let _ = sumList [1;2;3;4]			     

let _ =
  match [1;2;3] with
  | 1::[] -> "[1]"
  | 1::(2::(3::[])) -> "[1;2;3]"
  | _ -> "?"

let rec everyOther l =
  match l with
  | [] -> []
  | [e] -> [e]
  | hd::_::tl ->
     hd :: everyOther tl

let _ = everyOther [1;2;3;4;5]
let _ = everyOther [1;2]
let _ = everyOther [1;2;3;4;5;6;7]
let _ =	everyOther []
let _ = everyOther [1]

(* Giving names to intermediate values. *)		   
let quadruple x =
  match double x with
  | d -> d + d

(* New expression: let P = E1 in E2
   Like a match expression with only 1 case:

  let P = E1 in E2 
    can be written
  match E1 with P -> E2
 *)
let quadruple x =
  let d = double x
  in d + d

(* Nested lets *)
let _ =
  let x = 3+4 in
  let y = 5+6 in
  x + y

(* Let expressions can be used anywhere
   an expression can *)	
let _ = 3 + (let x = 4+5 in x+6)

(* Pattern [x;y;z] only matches a three-element list *)	      
let [x;y;z] = [1;2;3]	      

(* Run-time error: expected a three-element list,
   got a two-element list *)
let [x;y;z] = [1;2]

(* These tuples have different types *)		
let _ = (1, "hi", 2.0) 
let _ = (1, "hi")		
let _ = (1,1,1)

(* Pattern matching on tuples *)
let (a,b) = (1,"hi")

(* The pattern must contain the right number of
   elements, or else type error *)	      
let (a,b) = (1,2,3)

(* Nested pattern. *)
let ((x,y), h::t) = ((1,2), [3;4])
